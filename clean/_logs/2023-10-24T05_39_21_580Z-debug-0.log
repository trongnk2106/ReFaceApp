32 verbose stack Error: As of npm@5, the npm cache self-heals from corruption issues
32 verbose stack   by treating integrity mismatches as cache misses.  As a result,
32 verbose stack   data extracted from the cache is guaranteed to be valid.  If you
32 verbose stack   want to make sure everything is consistent, use `npm cache verify`
32 verbose stack   instead.  Deleting the cache can only make npm go slower, and is
32 verbose stack   not likely to correct any problems you may be encountering!
